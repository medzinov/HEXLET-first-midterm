# HEXLET-first-midterm

This little project is a part of my midterm attestation assignment as a Hexlet college student (www.hexlet.io)
The goal of this attestation is to atempt to create a web page from figma template using HTML and CSS

TEMPLATE https://www.figma.com/file/qHqVwEC5nxFbSQCdbsFCVk/template35

In the process i learned new positioning methods in CSS (which i should have know before starting the project, probably)
And come to conclusion that the person who designed the aforementioned figma template has questionable design skills, but i wish them all the best and become a better designer.

After compleating this first project i now have a better understanding of a software development tools and processes
I used my own PC instead of some oline HTML/CSS sandboxes, so i had to install VSCODE and a few extantions (Live server, prettier, etc.)
Installed WSL and set it up to work with Github, during which i (ofcourse) put wrong email adress and pushed my first commits to my Repo from wrong user...

But in the end after all mistakes i feel a wierdly accomplishmed, even after all day of work i feel energised.
and before this README file turns into the emotional insta post...

Signing out.
